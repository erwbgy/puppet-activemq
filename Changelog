0.2.1:

* Allow the configuration file to be specified and pass it on the command-line

* Set the java.io.tmpdir to be under the instance directory

* Start in the product directory so relative paths work as expected

0.2.0:

* Removed bind_address and replaced it with a config hash to set variables
that are used when templates are processed.
